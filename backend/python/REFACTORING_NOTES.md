# SOLID Principle Refactoring - Single Responsibility Principle (SRP)

## Overview
The original `app.py` violated the Single Responsibility Principle by handling multiple concerns:
- HTTP request/response handling
- Request validation
- Business logic (DICOM processing)
- File management
- Response formatting

## Refactored Structure

### 1. **Controllers** (`/controllers/`)
**Responsibility**: Handle HTTP requests and coordinate with services

- **`health_controller.py`**: Handles health check endpoints
- **`dicom_controller.py`**: Handles DICOM-related HTTP requests

### 2. **Services** (`/services/`)
**Responsibility**: Contain business logic and coordinate operations

- **`dicom_service.py`**: Orchestrates DICOM file downloading and metadata parsing
- **`dicom_downloader.py`**: Handles S3 file downloading (moved from root)
- **`dicom_parser.py`**: Handles DICOM metadata parsing (moved from root)

### 3. **Utils** (`/utils/`)
**Responsibility**: Provide reusable utility functions

- **`validators.py`**: Request validation logic
- **`response_handler.py`**: Standardized response formatting

### 4. **Main Application** (`app.py`)
**Responsibility**: Application configuration and route registration only

## Benefits of This Structure

### Single Responsibility Principle Compliance:
- **Controllers**: Only handle HTTP concerns
- **Services**: Only contain business logic
- **Utils**: Only provide utility functions
- **Main App**: Only handle app configuration and routing

### Additional Benefits:
- **Testability**: Each component can be unit tested independently
- **Maintainability**: Changes to business logic don't affect HTTP handling
- **Reusability**: Services and utils can be reused across different controllers
- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between layers
- **Extensibility**: Easy to add new endpoints or modify existing logic

## Key Changes Made:

1. **Extracted Controllers**: HTTP request handling moved to dedicated controller classes
2. **Created Service Layer**: Business logic centralized in service classes
3. **Added Validation Layer**: Request validation extracted to utility classes
4. **Standardized Responses**: Response formatting centralized
5. **Improved Error Handling**: More structured error handling across layers
6. **Enhanced Modularity**: Each file has a single, clear responsibility

This refactoring makes the codebase more maintainable, testable, and follows SOLID principles for better software design.
